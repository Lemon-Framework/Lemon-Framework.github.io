# About Lemon

Lemon is a micro framework inspired by Laravel and Flask. It lets you create application quickly with minimal code involved and handles everything else from you &mdash; from basic security (CSRF, XSS, ...) to routing and more. Using it is just dead simple.

Because of Lemon's micro framework architecture you can create an entire app in just one file, which is great for smaller projects.
